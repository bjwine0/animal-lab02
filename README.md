- As a user, I want to view the images on the page so that I can browse the photo collection.

Given that a user opens the application in the browser  
When the user navigates to the home page  
Then the photo gallery should display all of the images in the gallery  

- As a user, I want to be able to filter the images so that I can view only images that match a keyword.

Given that a user clicks on the dropdown menu  
When the user selects one of the options  
Then only the images whose keyword matches the option should be displayed  

- As a user, I want a simple, clean looking UI so that my photo gallery clearly displays the images in a grid like pattern.

Given that a user opens the application in the browser  
When the user navigates to the home page  
Then the images should be displayed in rows across the screen
